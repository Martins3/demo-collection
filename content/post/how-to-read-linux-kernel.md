Today, while I was talking about traditional poems with my wife, I told her that I almost recited all the poems in the book (written for Children).
Reciting the whole book is so alike reading the kernel line by line.

What's the correct way to read the kernel ? It answers your questions. It makes understanding others parts of computer science more easy. It enpowers my ability to read the code.

The code is endless in the kernel, I don't want to cover it, it's a trove and we want to steal as much as possible and as quickly as possible from it !

A excruciating memory suddenly occurred to me that I waste a summer vacation to read the *The Deep Learning Book*.
What happened next is I gave up and choose another research subject.

When the only goal of reading a book is finish it, the reward is nothing but a toggle on todolist.

Reading Linux Kernel source code, as many other learning progress, on the one hand, we want to sharp our mind.


It's time break away from addiction of spectacular.
Over years, we are indulged in the green blocks of github chart, number of solved problems in the leetcode and books has been read.
**These goals are natural, but not efficient, when we don't set up our goals clearly and attentionally.**

Similar mistakes shouldn't made again, so how to avoid it systematically ? **We should change our schema about making plans by adding another specification**: What's our goals ?
In the past, we set up the projects and corresponding deadline. The disadvantage of this paradigm is clear, as the deadline closing, we tend to revise the criteria to meet the plan.
The revision, in fact, is cheat on ourselves.

Now, **we only "cheat" others**. Only examinations, certifications, awards widely acknowledged are supposed to overcome with tricks.

As for Linux Kernel, What's our goal:
1. Answer questions, we will record all the [questions](https://github.com/Martins3/kernel-question)
2. A [summary](https://www.jianshu.com/p/e169a792a5a7) about how to read Linux kernel.

We will not write blog for others, only notes for myself. As for help others, why not answer question on the stackoverflow ?
