Why I begin write non-technological articles ? Learning by teaching is efficient. But there are other reasons for me to quit all kinds of social media such twitter,
`weibo` and `zhihu`. I started to be addicted to it four years ago, because it do help me and diverge me from the "normal" undergraduates.
And I appreciate what it has taught me.
For example, I stress the importance of learning English, keep me away from Students' Union, started to contempt the low quality education at early period and believe in
many other principals which forms what I am today.

`zhihu` doesn't change it's standpoint, although many senior users complaints that it's evolving into a recreational and superficial party in accelerated speed and the impetus is
th evil capital. It just become more abundant and give more choice to customer, it's appearance is projection of your interest and desire.

So, what on earth does change my mind to `zhihu` ? Most of time, the interaction with it is sliding screen down while looking for something may arouse me.
Reading is meaningless with seldom writing, and turn other into a loser.

Recently, after writing down some nonsense, a personal consciousness is waking in my body, it born during my high school period and vanish gradually after settle in the university.
Maybe, there are too many colorful and spectacular landscape to calm myself down to sit down and make a review.
Browsing the all kinds of wired answers under bizarre questions, their immature and insane ideas rush into your brain without chewing and rebound with precipitous speed.
This is my penultimate valedictory to the life of skimming.

`zhihu` is still my best friend and teacher, but I want to use it with more efficient way, as a manual.

At last, `zhihu billboard` is totally a shit, which spread anxiety, nationalism, consumerism and other disgusting opinions, but this is exactly what the masses cared about.
