Safety refers to the situation that when a system temporarily fails to
operate correctly, no catastrophic event happens.

For example, many process control systems, *such as those used for controlling nuclear power plants or
sending people into space*, are required to provide a high degree of safety

Many examples from the past (**and probably many more yet to come**) show how hard it is to build safe systems.

For example, to decide anything, a vote often has to be taken, incurring some delay and overhead.

The latter is important because the traditional understanding of a monopoly is somewhat antiquated with tech and has led to many people arguing to change its definition.

To operate on an entity, it is necessary to access it, for which we need an access point.

**Because** an access point is tightly associated with an entity, it
would seem convenient to use the address of an access point as a regular
name **for** the associated entity. **Nevertheless**, this is hardly ever done **as** such
naming is generally very inflexible and often human unfriendly.

Only if we loosen consistency can there be hope for attaining efficient solutions.
