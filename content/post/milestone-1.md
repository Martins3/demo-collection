Recently, I try to accept the truth that chasing girls is much more difficult than I had expected.
However, there is a vigilant alert worried about criterion is sliding down at a oblivious velocity.
Criteria, remind me of industrial pipeline, is already retrogression in contrast to true love as described by `Flipped`.

Had been beset by acne for years and limitation of circumstances of undergraduate stage where most of my acquaintances are boys, 
I became over optimistic and anxious to find out the girl. Now, the dust of fantasy blown up by ebullient wind is precipitating into limestone.

As my roommate suggest, love can't be captured, the humming bird will fly around when flower bloom.

Is the efforts trying to date unavailing if the relationship makes no difference to level up my life quality ?
Or Meeting the physiological demanding is at the prohibitive price.
The answer is subjective, for different mate may lead to varying conclusion.
