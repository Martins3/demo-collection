Let's review the lies we told to myself.
Why would we like to tell lies to ourselves even the evidences is clear ?
The reason is clear, admiting the mistakes or struggling out of the dilemma is horrible. 

1. We're superior than normal students and should learn something more difficult.

The consequences is suffering. So many evidences has signal the problem.

2. The acne will recure automatically.



The lies we are telling ourselves now :
1. circadian rhythms are important.
2. Not only teeth.
3. We can't finished the distributed system lab of MIT in five days.
