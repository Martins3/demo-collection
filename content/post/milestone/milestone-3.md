Recently, I used to express my subject feeling with a formula : I experience something, then I can't bear or can't stop falling love with something.
There are many doctrines should not be printed in my brain without doubts.
Be a tricky man instead of a stubborn man.
Life is complex than primary math which is always certain, it's teemed with probability and conditions.

Why we need principals ? The only purpose of them is we need some rules to instruct ourselves when dealing with new problems.
Most of time, it works, but sometimes, it became a doctrine. How ? Because some problems, we can't handle with any previous principals.

> * Hilarious anecdote from David Epstein:
> * "The wider world is mostly characterized by wicked learning environments, where you can’t see information. It’s hidden from us. Feedback is delayed and sometimes inaccurate.
>
> * One of the examples is a famous New York City physician who was renowned for his ability to predict that patients would get typhoid. He predicted the sickness time and again. He would palpate their tounge (feel around their tongue) and predict, weeks before patients had a single symptom, over and over, and became famous, and as one of his colleagues said, he was a more productive carrier of typhoid than even Typhoid Mary because he was giving his patients Typhoid with his hands. In that case, the feedback he was receiving was reinforcing exactly the wrong lesson.

> * So that’s the extreme of a wicked environment where your feedback teaches exactly the wrong lesson.”
