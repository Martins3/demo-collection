Recently, I try to accept the truth that chasing girls is much more difficult than I had expected.
However, there is a vigilant alert worried about criterion is sliding down at a oblivious velocity.
Criteria, remind me of industrial pipeline, is already retrogression in contrast to true love as described by `Flipped`.

Had been beset by acne for years and limitation of circumstances of undergraduate stage where most of my acquaintances are boys, 
I became over optimistic and anxious to find out the girl. Now, the dust of fantasy blown up by ebullient wind is precipitating into limestone.

As my roommate suggest, love can't be captured, the humming bird will fly around when you bloom.

Is the efforts trying to date unavailing if the relationship makes no difference to level up my life quality ?
Or Meeting the physiological demanding is at the prohibitive price.
The answer is subjective, for different mate may lead to varying conclusion.

During this important and critical period, attracting and superficial knickknack bring a flood of trivial chores that will filling my schedules and
set me away from what is substantial. Just imaging the life doing similar boring stuff everyday while browsing news unrelated with me, the life oppressed by the loads which take the whole lifespan to pay or 
the life with no risks but already rotted, how can I spend more time on vulgar entertainment ?

**We are supposed to be someone we determine now !**
Many hard-working students may have a clear schema about what to achieve and what to do.
But the world is changing at a faster speed before we recognize what has happened.
Better education, bigger cooperation and higher salary, what a tragedy if that is all what we chase.

After leaving the stupid `Huazhong university of Sci & Tech`, today, I can control my life almost totally.
To my disappointment, I didn't realize it timely, and continue my life with restrictions in my mind.

What is the correct way to get along with people who doesn't alike me ? In the past, for the benefit of cowardice, I yielded to the fear of being isolated by the undistinguished guys successfully.
Also, there is no need to show a disguise of them to dispel the anxiety of insisting what I'm doing.
Sheep mentality , referred to the worry of being the leader and attendance to stay in the center of the flock, has been overlook over the years.
Now that we can get everything we want from the internet, the influence of losing the leaders is little.
Trying to influence the crowd who are not supposed to be the candidates is unavailing! The correct and efficient approach is the social media, conference or seminar rather than
a embarrassing conversation taken place in the restaurant. After all, marrying with the girl you love is much earlier than transforming the stranger woman to your wife.
So what's my altitude to who surround with me while fail my expectation, they are invisible and now I try to influence the stranger in the internet.
