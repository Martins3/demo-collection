Leisure times forms me !
My hobbies are : writing(this blog), lol(maybe give up), basketball(if not so cold)

I am a vim fan. The `VS code` surely has some advantage over vim, but there are reasons to learn it. As for mastering it, it depends on you.

- linux kernel
- vim(spacevim neovim coc.vim ccls)  & Manjaro deepin
- compiler
- c++
- basketball & skateboard
