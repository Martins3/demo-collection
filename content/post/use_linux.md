Linux is certainty better than Microsoft Windows for cs students.
1. less games or poor support for it.
2. a [tech skill](https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/11/19/todays-top-tech-skills/)
3. better development environment for programming.

I have use the Linux for about the three years, it's wildly accepted that 
Linux is notorious user-unfriendly. The most powerful weapon conquering the monster is laziness.


Many novices are already scared away by the well-known Unix philosophy or a bunch of neat and dense checklist of commands.
Some brave and ambitious warriors try to get them familiar with the Linux by installing a virtual machine on their Windows
and quickly defected by tutorial about `vim`.

Linux is a operating system for everyone rather than millions of 
source code, or something only used engineers working in the database centers.
There are all kinds of blogs which share the wrong way to using Linux, for example,learning another command may used only three times during next 12 months.

1. Don't try `vim` if you are not a programmer.
2. Don't learn `vim` if you don't know how to install software in the Linux. I mean, `vim` is complex enough to separate it as another subject and you shouldn't 
use it at very early stage.
3. If there is a GUI substitution, don't use the command line version. You can compare `gdb` with [`gdbgui`](https://www.gdbgui.com/).
4. There is no need to master a complex tool to deal with some sporadically task.

So, why Linux seems to be so difficult ?

1. Many blogs which broadcasting the rumours are stale, Linux is much more user-friendly now (in 2019).
2. Trying to remember command lines, don't learn any new commands if you find yourself Google it frequently.
3. As for Chinese users, the stupid `CSDN` is also another obstacle.
