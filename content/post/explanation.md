This is not a introduction to myself, and there is no need to waste you, a stranger for me, several minutes to acknowledge some symmetrical and compositional information.

A symmetrical and compositional person is, although unique, boring and easy to be forgotten. In this era, everyone seems to hate considered as a mediocre guy, and wanna keep them in the spotlight. Disappointedly, this nature is out of being scared of ignorance instead of chasing something fantastic, essential and incredible to them.

Emancipating personality sometimes is illustrated as being different, of course, that's a superficial view of it. The spirit is encouraging doing what you fear and level up tolerance of failure.

What you do in your leisure time forms your life. With smart phone overwhelm the society, we even lost the anxiety of being 

It is the ideas rather than the hobby, appearance, experience or skills forms me. Now, I begin introduce myself.
## Stay away from social media
Nowadays, social medias converge our ideas and thought in a industrial way, it becomes much more efficient with censorship. Some high voted answers on `Zhihu`, several hotspot `Weibo` post or dozens of `Douyin` can easily form a new ideas in your brain without arguing and discussion.

Social medias relay ideas without prove, explanation or experiments, they just repeat.
## Stay away from video games
If you proudly acclaim that you have a strong mind and stringent management over your time table, just skip this part.
I used to be a [LOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) fan and I am now. I have tried all kinds of ways to quitting, from deleting the game to deleting the Windows.

It seems that the media has been controlled by game makers, if not, how could the `YouTubers` keep intimating that games are an essential part of our lives be possible?
When we blame the games, there some classical standpoints to defend themselves.

Games are innocent, but we have something more important to do. Playing game is relaxing, but they are too many much more efficient way to recharge yourself. It may make you more agile, but basketball does so too.

Popularity of games keep the young away from polices. Nobody want to see a bigger world. If the reality concerned you, just put your head into the virtual world, as if a ostrich.

Video games kills the spare time, the only chance to think, ask question and cause some trouble.

After getting rid of the endless and brain-washing social media and addicting video games, so what should we do to peace our curious and restless mind ? My solution is reading and writing.
Writing used to a solution for being self-disciplined, while reading is critical for superior judgement.
## Censorship is evil
The government is inpatient and arrogant. I feel terrible about the censorship about 10 years old, and fresh memory tells that some of my classmates joked at me as coward as I wouldn't have the courage to spread the sensitive thoughts publicly. Surely, I'm not a coward and they would prevent me from making the mistake. Had complained the stupid censorship for years, I comforted me with a new theory. The reason China need censorship is that stability is the basement of economical construction. With some many races living in Chain, instigation about break up the nation would be too easy.  

What disappointed me is that censorship become more and more strict nowadays, it blocked the ideas away form me one by one,  from Wikipedia to Media, and even gnu's documents.

## Rethink Intelligence
During my high school period, I was fortunately acquainted some clever guys. The feeling of being overwhelmed frighten me from time to time.

## Hardworking is Heroin
Hardworking is criminal if you don't know the meaning of what you are doing. Hardworking is criminal if you don't know the meaning of what you are pursuing. Hardworking is criminal if what you are pursuing is ineffective.
I hate someone recognize me as being able to finish the job if the superintendent releases the assignment. But, that's how the education system manufacture graduates.

## Admitting your mistake is the first step
Today, what I want to talk about is not about the mistake of someone, but for Chinese culture.

## Learned helplessness or Fearing failure
There is a interesting phenomenon that someone could be fearless when facing some problem beyond their ability. The reason is simple and plain. If he fail, he just deserve it and cost nothing.
But if he make it, thought hardly, there is a great bonus. The cost is just the fee of lottery ticket. It seems that they are not afraid of failure, the truth is the failure is mere to mention.

Trying to being perfect make us overstate the consequence of failure. Embarrassing, gaffe and being awkward in the spotlight are nightmare of someone, but these "critical" moments maybe be forgotten be audience about 7 seconds.
Most of us, specially young adults in university, seldom experience a catastrophe failure caused by our own decision. In fact, we don't have too many choices , there are best solution wherever we arrive.
Lacking of chance to confront risk and exaggerating failure makes us conservative when there is a choice. 

Fearing of failure,
