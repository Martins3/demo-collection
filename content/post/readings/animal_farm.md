[Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) When I introduce this book to one of my friends, he asked why this book has been banned in the mainland of Chain yet.
I don't know how to answer his question, but I feel that it maybe soon.

When I'm still a child, a voice saying that poor education still earns more money.
In fact, that's true and common business man may be the example who even didn't take high school still make more money than my uncle, a mathematical professor in 
a well-known university. But, out of some untold reason, he insist the importance of education. Apparently, this example is kind of anti-intelligenceï¼Œand that's we would like to talk about. Because it's just too boring to list a endless evidence
that higher education lead to higher salary. It's even kind of scaring to tell the truth for someone who gain little education that my uncle's classmates in colleges who work in technical giants earns dozens higher than the average.

As for the importance of education, I have a different perspective after reading these book. Education avoid us being taken advantage of.
The education I have take so far seems to be conspiracy, it try to transform children into young engineers with professional skills, but it never inspired about some more important questions.
They, the pigs, want more strong horses like Boxer. We are industrious enough at working for the pigs, but stingy to learn some alphabet.
