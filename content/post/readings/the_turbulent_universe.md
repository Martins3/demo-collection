According to this interpretation, the political, religious, moral, intellectual, and cultural characteristics of a society are part of the “superstructure” and are a result of the economic base. The economic fundamentals include the key role of the relationships of production—the way society is organized to produce and distribute goods and services. Marx also postulated the surplus theory of value in the form of wages, rent, interest, or profits. He said that although human labor power provides value, it was not equitably distributed. This class analysis overstated the role of classes in causality, for factors in the so-called superstructure—political, religious, and scientific—may at times supersede economic causes. Nevertheless, the Marxist emphasis on economic causes is a powerful insight in explaining societies of the past. It does not, however, adequately account for information societies that have emerged where new modes of production have appeared, such as individual contractors working in remote locations on computers.

根据这种解释，社会的政治，宗教，道德，知识和文化特征是“上层建筑”的一部分，是经济基础的结果。经济基础包括生产关系的关键作用，即组织社会进行生产和分配商品和服务的方式。马克思还以工资，租金，利息或利润的形式提出了剩余价值理论。他说，尽管人的劳动提供了价值，但价值并不是公平分配于劳动之中的。阶级分析夸大了阶级在因果关系中的作用，因为所谓的上层建筑中的因素（政治，宗教和科学）有时可能会取代经济原因。然而，就解释过去社会的而言，马克思主义者对经济原因的强调是富有洞察力的。然而，它没有充分考虑当今的信息社会，其中诞生了例如在远程工作的个体之类的新的生产方式。

Actually there are many causal factors at work in the rise or decline of societies or civilizations. The role of contingent events in history is often decisive; many of these may be unforeseen or accidental. Similarly for the role of great individuals or heroes in history (Napoleon or Jefferson), great religious prophets (St. Paul or Mohammed), or moral leaders (Gandhi or Martin Luther King). Innovative technological discoveries may rapidly transform a society—for example, the invention of electricity or antibiotics, automobiles or locomotives—and these may have unforeseen consequences. Let us leap ahead to the contemporary world to illustrate the perennial appearance of turbulence in human affairs.

实际上，有许多因果关系在社会或文明的兴衰中起作用。 偶然事件在历史中的作用通常是决定性的。 其中许多可能是不可预见的或偶然的。 同样，在历史上伟大的个人或英雄（拿破仑或杰斐逊），伟大的宗教先知（圣保罗或穆罕默德）或道德领袖（甘地或马丁·路德·金）的角色也是如此。 创新的技术发现可能会迅速改变整个社会，例如电或抗生素，汽车或机车的发明，并且可能会带来无法预料的后果。 让我们跳到当代世界来说明动荡是人类事务中的常态。


## Wars in the Twentieth Century
There are many motives in human nature and socio-economic-political causes that are responsible for conflicts, revolutions, and wars. These include aggression, jealousy, greed, lust for power, hatred, the penchant for plunder and conquest, national pride, racial and ethnic hatred, and economic competition for markets. There are also misguided hopes for victory, fear of the enemy, and the passion for glory. The role of contingent events in human history is of course often decisive. Thus, the assassination of the archduke of Serbia, Franz Ferdinand of Austria (heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne), and his wife, Sophia, in 1914 in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, ignited World War I, which began a month later. The assassins were nationalistic Serbs who wished Serbia to break away and establish an independent country, which they did after World War I, as part of Yugoslavia. Another contingent event, the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, by the Japanese, led the United States to declare war on Japan.

人性和社会经济，政治导致冲突，革命和战争的重要因素。这些包括侵略，嫉妒，贪婪，对权力的渴望，仇恨，对掠夺和征服的爱好，民族自豪感，种族和族裔仇恨以及对市场竞争。人们也有对胜利的误解，对敌人的恐惧以及对荣耀的热情。当然，偶然事件在人类历史中的作用通常是决定性的。因此，1914年，塞尔维亚大公，奥地利的弗朗兹·费迪南德（奥匈帝国王位继承人）及其妻子索菲娅被暗杀，引发了一个月之后爆发的第一次世界大战。刺客门是希望塞尔维亚脱离并建立一个独立的国家的民族主义的塞族人，他门的目标在第一次世界大战之后实现。另一个偶然事件是日本于1941年12月7日轰炸了珍珠港，其导致美国向日本宣战。

Of course both of the above historical events—the assassination and the bombing—were part of already-inflamed political and economic conditions, and there were trends that were at work. In World War I, there were economic, nationalistic, and military rivalries between the great powers of Europe—France, Britain, and Russia versus Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In World War II, Germany and Italy had allied with Japan against the United States and Britain, and although the Japanese attack was the specific event that led the United States to enter the war, there was no doubt that underlying economic, political, ethnic, and military factors helped to bring it about. The Japanese claimed that trade barriers prevented them from free trade, and they tried to cripple the United States for its economic strangulation of Japan. Yet these events did occur, and without them subsequent events may have been different.
当然，上述两个历史事件（暗杀和轰炸）都是愈发激烈的政治对抗和糟糕的经济状况的部分结果。 第一次世界大战期间，欧洲大国（法国，英国和俄罗斯）与德国和奥匈帝国之间在经济，民族和军事上存在竞争。 在第二次世界大战中，德国和意大利与日本结盟反对美国和英国，尽管日本的袭击是导致美国参战的具体原因，但毫无疑问，潜在的经济，政治，种族，军事因素其根本推手。 日本声称贸易壁垒阻止了它们进行自由贸易，他们试图削弱美国对日本的经济束缚。这些事件确实发生了，没有它们，随后的事件可能会有所不同。

Another cause of social change is ideological. Prior to World War II there were profound differences in ideas and values between Nazi Germany and the West. Fascism was a nationalistic movement that condemned the democracies of the Western powers and extolled the heroic virtues of Macht. Mussolini emphasized the power of the fascist state and attempted to restore the martial virtues of the Roman Empire. Hitler frightened the democratic countries and caused them to rearm; this fear was exacerbated as Nazi Panzer tanks and the Luftwaffe provoked a domino effect, and country after country fell. Hitler blamed the Treaty of Versailles after World War I as the reason for his grievance. He said that Germany needed lebensraum (living space); Western colonial empires dominated the world, and Germany was left out in the cold. He affirmed that the blond, blue-eyed Aryan race was superior to all others, and he wished to establish a New Order throughout Europe. He sought to dominate or exterminate those he considered inferior, such as Poles, Slavs, and Jews. Hitler built his ideology on anti-Semitism, attributing Germany’s plight to a Jewish conspiracy. He condemned the Jews for being both finance capitalists and communist commissars. The magnetic personality of this former Austrian paperhanger inflamed the German public, whose economy was in tatters, and who were angered by the Treaty of Versailles. It was the impassioned oratory of Hitler that was able to rouse them to support rearmament in preparation for World War II. Although many were opposed to him, there was little they could do to confront the fascist dictatorship that Hitler imposed. The role of mendacious leaders in history has led to untold bloodshed and suffering.
社会变革的另一个原因是意识形态。第二次世界大战之前，纳粹德国与西方之间在想法和价值观上存在着巨大的差异。法西斯主义是谴责西方列强的民主制度的民族主义运动，并夸大了马赫特的英勇美德。墨索里尼强调了法西斯主义国家的力量，并试图恢复罗马帝国的军事美德。希特勒恐吓民主国家，迫使它们重新武装了起来。纳粹的装甲坦克和德国空军引发多米诺骨牌效应，恐惧蔓延到一个国家又一个国家。第一次世界大战后，希特勒对于《凡尔赛条约》表示不满。他说，德国需要生存空间（lebensraum）；西方殖民帝国统治着整个世界，然而德国却被冷落。他申明，金发碧眼的雅利安人种族优于其他种族，他希望在整个欧洲建立新秩序。他试图统治或消灭他认为较弱的人，例如波兰人，斯拉夫人和犹太人。希特勒的意识形态建立在反犹太主义的基础上，将德国的困境归因于犹太人的阴谋。他谴责犹太人既是金融资本家又是共产党委员。这位前奥地利造纸行家的强硬性格煽动了被《凡尔赛条约》激怒并且处于经济困境的德国公众。希特勒的热情洋溢的演说唤醒了他们为第二次世界大战做准备。尽管许多人反对他，但他们面对希特勒的法西斯独裁政权却无能为力。贪婪的领导人导致了无法估量的流血和痛苦。

I served in the US Army during World War II and was in the army of occupation, stationed in Munich, Germany. What fascinated me were my many nocturnal visits to the Munich beer hall where Hitler first got his start. He was imprisoned, eventually released, and went on to build the National Socialist (Nazi) Party and to defeat the left-wing opposition of the communist and social democratic parties. How Hitler managed to seize power and persuade the German population to support him is a lesson in political deception and power. Germany was a great nation in which science and philosophy, music and metaphysics flourished; nevertheless, it succumbed to a madman. We should be grateful that Germany has since recovered after World War II—itself a kind of miracle, that it eliminated the Prussian Junker military class that dominated Germany so long, and that it was able to build a democratic society and join other democracies, full of contrition about the Nazi episode. It was willing to take part in building a new European Parliament and the European Common Market by eschewing the rabid nationalism of the past. Germany thus redeemed itself in the eyes of the democratic world—in spite of the horrors of its Nazi past. This demonstrates how the tumultuous gyrations that can traumatize an otherwise civilized nation can be overcome.
我在第二次世界大战期间曾在美国陆军中服役，并曾驻扎在德国慕尼黑的占领军中。希特勒发迹的慕尼黑啤酒馆让我着迷，而且我多次夜间到访。他坐过牢，但最终被释放，建立起来了民族社会党（纳粹党）并打败共产党和社会民主党的左翼反对派。希特勒如何设法夺权并说服德国人民支持他是政治欺骗和权力的教科书。德国是科学，哲学，音乐和形而上学蓬勃发展的伟大国家。但是，它屈服于一个疯子。我们应该感激德国自第二次世界大战以来恢复了生机，这本身就是一种奇迹，它消除了长期统治着德国的普鲁士容克军事阶层，并能够建立一个民主社会并加入其他民主国家，和纳粹时代的截然不同。它愿意通过避免过去狂热的民族主义来参与建立新的欧洲议会和欧洲共同市场。尽管有纳粹的过去，德国因此在民主世界的眼中赎回了自己。这证明创伤原本文明的国家的动荡不安是可以被克服的。
